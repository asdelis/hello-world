//makeVector(initialCapacity ) -- return a vector with the given capacity and a size of 0
//^ constructor

//freeVector(MyVec) -- deallocate any heap memory used by the MyVector object
//^ deconstructor

//pushBack -- works like it does for std::vector
//^ method

//popBack -- works like it does for std::vector
//^ method

//get(myVec, index) -- return the appropriate value in the vector
//works like [] does for std::vectors
//^ method

//set(myVec, index, newValue) -- set the appropriate value in the vector
//(works like [] for std::vector)
//^ method

//growVector(myVec) -- should double the capacity of the vector.
//The values should be copied from the old array to the new array
//^ method

//getSize() returns the size

//getCapacity() returns capacity
//(since your member variables are now private, you need these methods for users
//to be able to see those values)
//^ method
